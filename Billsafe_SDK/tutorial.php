/**
 * This tutorial helps you getting started with the BillSAFE SDK.
 *
 * We assume that you have read the "BillSAFE Integration Guide" which explains
 * all methods provided by the BillSAFE API as well as the required parameters
 * and the responses.
 *
 * The BillSAFE SDK encapsulates the NVP protocol that is internally used for
 * communication with the BillSAFE API server. This means you don't have to
 * deal with the NVP protocol at all. In order to invoke an API method all
 * you have to do is assemble the required parameters and use the SDK's
 * callMethod()-function. callMethod() returns a stdClass-object which contains
 * the API response in a structured manner.
 *
 * The SDK requires PHP 5 (or above) with support for SSL. It has no
 * dependencies to third party libraries.
 *
 * To get up and running with the SDK follow these steps:
 *
 * 1.
 * Place the "Billsafe" folder somewhere on your webserver and make sure it is
 * not accessible directly from the web.
 *
 * 2.
 * Add the path to the "Billsafe" folder to your PHP include path. This can
 * either be accomplished by editing the "php.ini" file (preferred way) or by
 * calling ini_set() at runtime. The following example demonstrates the latter:
 */
ini_set('include_path', ini_get('include_path') . PATH_SEPARATOR . '/path/where/you/put/the/Billsafe/folder');

/**
 * 3.
 * Edit the billsafe_ini.php file which was shipped with the SDK and insert your
 * API credentials etc. Leave "isLiveMode" set to false whilst you are developing
 * and testing your application! Only set this value to true after everything is
 * working in sandbox-mode and BillSAFE has explicitly approved your application.
 * Make sure to update the "applicationVersion" value every time you release a
 * new version of your application. This helps BillSAFE to localize errors
 * that might occur only in specific releases. BillSAFE recommends to include
 * a release number as well as a release date, e.g. "v.1.2 beta (2010-12-29)".
 *
 * 4.
 * Create a Billsafe_Sdk object. Optionally you may provide the path to the
 * billsafe_ini.php file in the constructor. If you omit it, the default
 * billsafe_ini.php file located in the sdk folder will be used.
 */
require 'Billsafe/Sdk.php';

$bs = new Billsafe_Sdk('/path/to/billsafe_ini.php');

/**
 * If you do not want to make use of the billsafe_ini.php file, you may
 * alternatively stick your API credentials into setCredentials().
 */
$bs = new Billsafe_Sdk();
$bs->setCredentials(array(
    'merchantId'             => '12345678',
    'merchantLicenseSandbox' => '05798d947329d390efaa9f4d5416de4b',

/**
 * To see what information is sent to the BillSAFE API server and what the
 * response looks like, you can inject a logger object. This might be useful
 * for debugging during development. You can either provide your own logger
 * class (which must implement the interface Billsafe_Logger) or use one of the
 * Billsafe_LoggerXXX classes that come with the SDK.

/**
 * 5.
 * To invoke an API method simply use the callMethod() function which requires
 * two arguments.
 *   1. The name of the API method to invoke
 *   2. An array or object containing the parameters for that API method
 * The API parameters can be specified in various ways. The simplest but
 * probably not the most convenient way is to specify the parameters exactly
 * as mentioned in the "BillSAFE Integration Guide". Here is an example for

/**
 * 6.
 * callMethod() returns a stdClass which contains the API response in a
 * structured manner. The output of the above var_dump($response) looks
 * like this:
 *
 * object(stdClass)#1 (2) {
 *    ["ack"]=>
 *    string(2) "OK"
 *    ["token"]=>
 *    string(26) "4d2db2648e7155d2db2648e7ef"
 *  }
 *
 * In case an error occurred, the output would look something like this:
 *
 * object(stdClass)#1 (2) {
 *   ["ack"]=>
 *   string(5) "ERROR"
 *   ["errorList"]=>
 *   array(1) {
 *     [0]=>
 *     object(stdClass)#2 (2) {
 *       ["code"]=>
 *       string(3) "215"
 *       ["message"]=>
 *       string(30) "Parameters of customer missing"
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * The "BillSAFE Integration Guide" describes the responses of API
 * methods without considering the hierachy. For example the
 * getTransactionResult API method is described as returning the
 * following elements:
 *
 * - status
 * - declineReason_code
 * - declineReason_message
 * - transactionId
 * - customer_gender
 * - customer_firstname
 * - customer_lastname
 * - customer_street
 * - customer_houseNumber
 * - customer_postcode
 * - customer_city
 * - customer_country
 * - customer_dateOfBirth
 * - customer_email
 * - customer_phone
 * - custom_{n}
 *
 * However the SDK converts the flat elements back into the intended
 * structure by interpreting the underscores as separators of the
 * hierarchy levels. Therefore a var_dump() of the response of the
 * getTransactionResult API method will look something like this:
 *
 * object(stdClass)#1 (2) {
 *   ["ack"]=>
 *   string(5) "OK"
 *   ["status"]=>
 *   string(8) "ACCEPTED"
 *   ["transactionId"]=>
 *   string(10) "9876543210"
 *   ["customer"]=>
 *   object(stdClass)#2 (11) {
 *     ["gender"]=>
 *     string(1) "m"
 *     ["firstname"]=>
 *     string(3) "Max"
 *     ["lastname"]=>
 *     string(10) "Mustermann"
 *     ["street"]=>
 *     string(9) "Musterweg"
 *     ["houseNumber"]=>
 *     string(4) "12 a"
 *     ["postcode"]=>
 *     string(5) "12345"
 *     ["city"]=>
 *     string(11) "Musterstadt"
 *     ["country"]=>
 *     string(2) "DE"
 *     ["dateOfBirth"]=>
 *     string(10) "1982-12-31"
 *     ["email"]=>
 *     string(26) "max.mustermann@example.com"
 *     ["phone"]=>
 *     string(12) "0123/4567890"
 *   }
 *   ["custom"]=>
 *   array(3) {
 *     [0]=>
 *     string(19) "Benutzerdefiniert 1"
 *     [1]=>
 *     string(19) "Benutzerdefiniert 2"
 *     [2]=>
 *     string(19) "Benutzerdefiniert 3"
 *   }
 * }
 *
 * Note that the customer_XXX elements have become attributes of a
 * customer stdClass object and that custom_{n} has been transformed
 * into an array of strings.
 * The declineReason_XXX elements are not part of the response here,
 * since they are optional and depend on the "status" attribute.
 *
 *
 * A response always contains the attribute "ack" as an
 * acknowledgement status which is either "OK" or "ERROR".
 *
 * The following example shows how to check whether the API method was
 * executed successfully and how to print out any error message that might
 * have occurred.
